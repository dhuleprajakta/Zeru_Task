# Wallet Analysis: High and Low Scoring Wallets

## Objective:
The goal of this analysis is to review the behavior of the top 5 high-scoring wallets and the bottom 5 low-scoring wallets based on the credit score derived from clustering analysis. This helps in understanding the distinct patterns associated with high and low scores, which reflect wallet behaviors such as transaction consistency, liquidity management, and repayment practices.

## High-Scoring Wallets (Top 5)

### 1. **Wallet A (Score: 100 - Cluster 3)**
   - **Behavioral Pattern:**
     - Consistent deposits, borrowings, and repayments.
     - Rarely liquidated, indicating low risk.
     - Active for a long duration, showing responsible engagement with the protocol.
   - **Justification:**
     - The wallet has a well-balanced mix of deposits and borrowings with frequent repayments, which indicates responsible use of the platform. The absence of liquidations further suggests careful financial management.
  
### 2. **Wallet B (Score: 100 - Cluster 3)**
   - **Behavioral Pattern:**
     - Balanced ratio of deposits and withdrawals.
     - Active over a long period with very few liquidations.
   - **Justification:**
     - The wallet’s transactional behavior reflects a stable and healthy interaction with the protocol. The infrequent liquidations and regular transactions indicate a low-risk user.

### 3. **Wallet C (Score: 85 - Cluster 2)**
   - **Behavioral Pattern:**
     - Active with a mix of deposits, borrowings, and repayments.
     - A slightly higher liquidation ratio compared to Cluster 3 but still considered low-risk.
   - **Justification:**
     - Wallet C has a generally responsible transactional pattern. The wallet’s high repayment rate and low liquidation frequency indicate that while it has occasional risks, it generally uses the protocol well.

### 4. **Wallet D (Score: 85 - Cluster 2)**
   - **Behavioral Pattern:**
     - Deposits and withdrawals show good consistency.
     - Occasional borrowing, mostly repaid without liquidation.
   - **Justification:**
     - The wallet is used with occasional borrowing that is repaid over time. Despite some liquidations, the wallet maintains responsible behavior, leading to a relatively high score.

### 5. **Wallet E (Score: 70 - Cluster 1)**
   - **Behavioral Pattern:**
     - Lower activity in deposits compared to borrowings.
     - Moderate repayment frequency and minimal liquidations.
   - **Justification:**
     - Wallet E engages more in borrowing and is less active in deposits. The medium repayment rate suggests that the wallet may have been in debt at times but hasn't exhibited risky behaviors such as frequent liquidations.

## Low-Scoring Wallets (Bottom 5)

### 1. **Wallet F (Score: 50 - Cluster 0)**
   - **Behavioral Pattern:**
     - High borrowing with minimal repayments.
     - Frequent liquidations, indicating financial distress or poor management.
   - **Justification:**
     - Wallet F shows high-risk behavior with high borrowing and repayment struggles. The frequency of liquidations suggests a failure to meet repayment obligations, which severely impacts its score.

### 2. **Wallet G (Score: 50 - Cluster 0)**
   - **Behavioral Pattern:**
     - Sporadic and erratic deposits and withdrawals.
     - High frequency of liquidations.
   - **Justification:**
     - The irregular transaction patterns, along with multiple liquidations, point to a wallet that may be exploiting the protocol. Such erratic behavior typically results in a low score due to its potential risk to the system.

### 3. **Wallet H (Score: 50 - Cluster 0)**
   - **Behavioral Pattern:**
     - Over-reliance on borrowing without sufficient deposits or repayments.
     - Frequent liquidations.
   - **Justification:**
     - Wallet H shows patterns of irresponsible borrowing, and the frequent liquidations indicate a failure to repay. This wallet represents high-risk behavior, resulting in a low score.

### 4. **Wallet I (Score: 50 - Cluster 0)**
   - **Behavioral Pattern:**
     - Rapid transactions, with high-frequency deposits and withdrawals but low engagement in borrowing and repayment.
   - **Justification:**
     - The wallet shows a pattern of quick, frequent transactions with no clear long-term financial strategy. The behavior could be indicative of bot-like activity or exploitation of short-term opportunities.

### 5. **Wallet J (Score: 50 - Cluster 0)**
   - **Behavioral Pattern:**
     - Minimal deposits, frequent borrowings, and negligible repayments.
     - High liquidations leading to poor wallet health.
   - **Justification:**
     - Wallet J has high borrowing activity with little repayment or deposits. The consistent liquidations further confirm a poor user strategy, reflecting a high-risk profile and contributing to the low score.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the top and bottom 5 scoring wallets highlights key patterns that contribute to high and low credit scores. High-scoring wallets typically exhibit responsible financial behaviors, such as consistent deposits, repayments, and minimal liquidations. In contrast, low-scoring wallets often exhibit erratic behavior, excessive borrowing without repayment, and frequent liquidations, signaling a high level of risk. These insights can be used to refine the credit scoring system and target risky behavior while rewarding responsible users.
